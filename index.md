# Newdle

**Newdle** is the new, shiny tool brought to you by the [Indico Team](https://getindico.io/about/) @ [CERN](https://home.cern/). Here at CERN we **hold a lot of meetings**. While [Indico](https://getindico.io/) makes it super easy to manage those meetings, we still **lose a lot of time** trying to schedule them, which usually involves numerous emails and private messages. That is what newdle has been created for: to streamline the process of choosing **the perfect date and time** for your next meeting/event.

Newdle is part of the [MALT project](https://malt.web.cern.ch/malt/).

## Why another tool?

It's true that there are already several commercial and Open Source solutions available that provide ad-hoc "polls". However, we have noticed that none of those tools seem to offer, at the same time, a user-friendly and modern interface and the additional freedom and flexibility that come with being part of an Open Source ecosystem. Additionally, none of them seem to seamlessly integrate with other enterprise systems.

### Integration

Newdle can currently fetch free-busy information from **Exchange servers**. This information can be used while deciding on candidate slots ("when is everyone free?") as well as when answering to a "poll" ("when am I free?"). We are currently working on integrating with other providers.

Newdle is also developed by the same people who are behind [Indico](https://getindico.io/), and that's not by pure chance. newdle naturally complements Indico, as it targets what comes immediately before the actual creation of a meeting. This is why we would like to have the possibility to **create meetings on Indico** once a final date is decided (still work in progress!).



## Features

- Add participants searching by name and/or email address
- Choose time slots for different days
